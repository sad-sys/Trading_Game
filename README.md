# C++ Stock Trading Game

This project is a console-based stock trading simulation game written in C++. It allows users to simulate buying and selling stocks based on historical data, manage a portfolio, and visualize their portfolio's value over time.

## Features

- **Stock Trading**: Buy and sell stocks from a predefined list of companies.
- **Portfolio Management**: Keep track of the stocks you own and their values.
- **Historical Data Simulation**: Use real historical stock prices for simulation.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the portfolio's value changes over time in a simple text-based graph.
- **Command Interface**: Use commands like `buy`, `sell`g, `check`, `next`, and `profile` to interact with the game.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **C++ Programming**: The game is entirely written in C++, showcasing proficiency in the language.
- **File I/O**: Reads stock data from CSV files, demonstrating file input/output operations in C++.
- **Data Parsing**: Includes CSV parsing to extract stock data.
- **Use of Standard Libraries**: Utilizes standard libraries such as `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<vector>`, and `<string>`.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Although the provided code is mostly procedural, the structuring around functions and data manipulation hints at OOP principles.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for file operations and data parsing.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implements algorithms for searching, data processing, and simple visualization.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang).
3. Compile the code. For example, using g++:

   ```bash
   g++ -o tradingGame test.cpp
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./tradingGame
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the game.

## Game Instructions

- **buy [stock symbol]**: Purchase a stock. You must have enough funds in your portfolio.
- **sell [stock symbol]**: Sell a stock if you own it.
- **check**: Displays the current value of your portfolio and remaining funds.
- **next**: Moves to the next day, updating stock prices based on the historical data.
- **profile**: Shows the stocks currently owned and their total value.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork this project, make changes, and submit pull requests. We're always looking for ways to improve the simulation and add new features!
